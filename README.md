Flaredown makes it easy for people to track symptoms over time, and learn how to control them. Our goal is to analyze the aggregate data from users of this tool to understand the probable effects of treatments and environmental stressors on chronic illness.

Help would be appreciated! Please join us in [slack #flaredown](https://rubyforgood.herokuapp.com/) or raise a github issue, or email the contact@flaredown email which is currently checked every few days.

## Environment

* PostgreSQL 12.8
* MongoDB 4.4.9 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
* Redis 6.2.3
* Ruby 2.6.5 (see [RVM](https://rvm.io/) also)
* Node 12.22.6

You can spin up instances of the required data-stores in Docker containers using `docker compose up` in the project root.

On macOS, you can install libpq by running `brew install libpq && brew link --force libpq && bundle config --local build.pg "--with-ldflags=-L$(brew --prefix libpq)/lib --with-pg-include=$(brew --prefix libpq)/include"`, which is required for `bundle install` to succeed.

## Installation
