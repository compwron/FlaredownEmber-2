- Add (very often requested) mobile notifications for reminding to log and take treatments
- Add ability to delete a checkin? 
- Internationalization improvements

- Upgrade to new ZIP code detection library for finding weather location (old one is going to be end of life soon)

#### Value of the Project

1. Flaredown helps patients (users) reduce their "time to diagnosis" because patients with chronic conditions which can take upwards of five years for many patients and is expensive and miserable as people don't know what they have and therefore can't treat it. 
2. Help users track data which helps users apply for disability benefits as they can show their charts over time (this has really worked!)
3. Many chronic diseases prevent in very individual way and it can be hard for a patient to collect and understand solid  data about what treatments work and don't work.
4. On the research side, providing the anonymized data set for usage by researchers who can help find solutions!
